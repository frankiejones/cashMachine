//1.Ability to accept a user pin (pre-defined inside of parameters to start with
//2.Check the user pin is correct before letting someone access their account- 3 attempts maximum. 
//3.Withdraw from their bank account A.Check withdrawals for the day, a limit of £250 is normally used. 
//So, if a user has already withdrawn £150, they can only do £100 more. (Don’t worry about the day / time yet) 
//4.Deposit into their account up to £250 a time... isn’t so straightforward when we get to prompts.  
//5.Change the user pin with validation
//6.Check balance and cry at the amount.
//7.Statement of actions of the transactions occurred 
//8.Exchange currency - you can pick your currency. 
//If a user wants to exchange £100 and the conversion is 1.5, then they’d get 150 of another currency, for example.
